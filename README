NAME
	epkill - procps utilties with environment constraints

DESCRIPTION
	epkill is a fork of procps-ng verion 3.3.10, but only
	with the utilities pidof, pgrep, and pkill. These
	utilities have been enhanced to allow specifying
	constraints on the environment variables of the found
	processes.

	epidof          pidof with environment constraints
	epgrep          pgrep with environment constraints
	epkill          pkill with environment constraints

	For each of these three programs a wrapper has been
	added. These wrapper add constraints that make them
	only find processes running in the display server
	from which is it started.

	dpidof          epidof with display isolation
	dpgrep          epgrep with display isolation
	dpkill          epkill with display isolation

RATIONALE
	If you have multiple display servers running, it is
	common that you want to kill a program that is you
	have running in multiple display servers, but only
	kill it in a specific display server. For example,
	if you are restarting you window manager you may
	also want to restart panels and other programs.
