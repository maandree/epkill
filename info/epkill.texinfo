@node Overview
@chapter Overview

epkill is a collection of utilities for filtering
and killing processes based on their name and environment.
The epkill collection includes six utilises:

@table @command
@item epidof
Find the process ID of a running program.

@item epgrep
Look up processes based on name and other attributes.

@item epkill
Signal processes based on name and other attributes

@item dpidof
Wraps @command{epidof} with the current display preselected.

@item dpgrep
Wraps @command{epgrep} with the current display preselected.

@item dpkill
Wraps @command{epkill} with the current display preselected.
@end table

All of these commands allow you to specify how the
processes' environment variables must look to be included
in the result.



@node epidof Invocation
@chapter @command{epidof} Invocation

@command{epidof} finds the process ID:s (PID:s) of the named
programs. It prints those ID:s to the standard output.

@command{epidof} supports the following options, and any
number of program names.

@table @option
@item -c
@itemx --check-root
Restrict returned process ID:s to programms running with the
same root directory. This option is ignored for non-root users,
as they will be unable to check the current root directory of
processes they do not own.

@item -s
@itemx --single-shot
Return only one process ID.

@item -x
@itemx --scripts
Causes @command{epidof} to also return process ID:S of shells
running the named scripts.

@item o
@itemx --omit-pid PID...
Tells @command{epidof} to omit processes with the specified process ID.
The special pid @code{%PPID} from @command{pidof} is not supported;
if you are in a shell, @code{$$} should do the trick. This option can
be used multiple times.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Display this help information, except a little more concise.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Print the name and version of the program.
@end table



@node epgrep Invocation
@chapter @command{epgrep} Invocation

@command{epgrep} looks through the currently running processes and lists
the process ID:s which match the selection criteria.  All the criteria
have to match.

@command{epgrep} supports the following options and one extended regular
expression for the program name of the processes to list.

@table @option
@item -d
@itemx --delimiter DELIMITER
Sets the string used to delimit each process ID in the output
(by default a new line).

@item -l
@itemx --list-name
List the process name as well as the process ID.

@item -a
@itemx --list-full
List the command line as well as the process ID.

@item -v
@itemx --inverse
List the process only if all criteria was not matched.
That is, if one or more criteria was unmatched.

@item -w
@itemx --lightweight
Shows all thread ID:s instead of PID:s.

@item -c
@itemx --count
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.
When count does not match anything, for example returns zero, the
command will return non-zero value.

@item -f
@itemx --full
The pattern is normally only matched against the process name.
With this option, the match is against the full command line.

@item -g
@itemx --pgroup PGRP,...
Only match processes in the process group ID:s listed. Process
group 0 is translated into the current process group.

@item -G
@itemx --group GID,...
Only match processes whose real group ID is listed.
Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.

@item -n
@itemx --newest
Select only the most recently started of the matching processes.

@item -o
@itemx --oldest
Select only the least recently started of the matching processes.

@item -P
@itemx --parent PPID,...
Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed.

@item -s
@itemx --session SID,...
Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.
Session ID 0 is the current session.

@item -t
@itemx --terminal TERM,...
Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed. The
terminal name should be specified without the @file{/dev/} prefix.

@item -u
@itemx --euid EUID,...
Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed.
Either the numeri cal or symbolical value may be used.

@item -U
@itemx --uid UID,...
Only match processes whose real user ID is listed.
Either the numeri cal or symbolical value may be used.

@item -x
@itemx --exact
Only match processes whose names (or command line if
@option{-f} is  specified) exactly match the pattern.

@item -F
@itemx --pidfile FILE
Read PID:s from file.

@item -L
@itemx --logpidfile
Fail if file selected with @option{-F} not locked.

@item --ns PID
Match processes that belong to the same namespaces.
Root is required to match processes from other users.

@item --nslist NAME,...
Match only the provided namespaces. Available
namespaces: ipc, mnt, net, pid, user, uts.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Display this help information, except a little more concise.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Print the name and version of the program.
@end table

The options @option{-n}, @option{-o} and @option{-v} can not be combined.



@node epkill Invocation
@chapter @command{epkill} Invocation

@command{epgrep} send a signal (by default SIGTERM) to currently running
processes whose name match a pattern and have satisfactory selection criteria.
All the criteria have to match.

@command{epkill} supports the following options and one extended regular
expression for the program name of the processes to list.

@table @option
@item -SIGNAL
@itemx --signal SIGNAL
Defines the signal to send to each matched process.
Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name can be used.

@item -e
@itemx --echo
Display what is killed.

@item -c
@itemx --count
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.
When count does not match anything, for example returns zero, the
command will return non-zero value.

@item -f
@itemx --full
The pattern is normally only matched against the process name.
With this option, the match is against the full command line.

@item -g
@itemx --pgroup PGRP,...
Only match processes in the process group ID:s listed. Process
group 0 is translated into the current process group.

@item -G
@itemx --group GID,...
Only match processes whose real group ID is listed.
Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.

@item -n
@itemx --newest
Select only the most recently started of the matching processes.

@item -o
@itemx --oldest
Select only the least recently started of the matching processes.

@item -P
@itemx --parent PPID,...
Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed.

@item -s
@itemx --session SID,...
Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.
Session ID 0 is the current session.

@item -t
@itemx --terminal TERM,...
Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed. The
terminal name should be specified without the @file{/dev/} prefix.

@item -u
@itemx --euid EUID,...
Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed.
Either the numeri cal or symbolical value may be used.

@item -U
@itemx --uid UID,...
Only match processes whose real user ID is listed.
Either the numeri cal or symbolical value may be used.

@item -x
@itemx --exact

@option{-f} is  specified) exactly match the pattern.
